Capture The flag!

# Idea
Based on cyber security programs; Decipher the codes to stop the hacker from getting into your phone Capture the Flag style, the app has ciphers that you will decipher in-game. You must find 5 cyphers and a key in 2 mins in the Notes App map(Easiest difficulty). This project will showcase what I have gained from knowledge and experience in coding with Dart language and using Flutter UI software to finish this app.
